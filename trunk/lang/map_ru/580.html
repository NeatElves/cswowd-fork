<h4>Sunwell Plateau</h4>
<b>Sunwell Plateau</b> is a new 25-man raid instance located on the <a href="?zone=4080">Isle of Quel'Danas</a> which will be implemented with Patch 2.4. The instance will be the the most difficult in the game until Wrath of the Lich King, and is intended for <a href="?zone=3959">Black Temple</a>/<a href="?zone=3606">Hyjal</a> geared raiders. The instance bosses drop tokens redeemable for new pieces added to the Tier 6 Armor Sets and loot up to par with that of <a href="?zone=3959">Black Temple</a>.
<br>
<br>
This instance apprently requires no attunement and will be available to all players at launch, but the last 3 bosses (including the eradar demon lord, Kil'jaedan) will only become available as the server completes daily quests for the <a href="?faction=1077">Shattered Sun Offensive</a>.
