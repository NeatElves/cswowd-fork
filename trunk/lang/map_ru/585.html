<b>Magisters' Terrace</b> is a new 5-man instance located on the <a href="?zone=4080">Isle of Quel'Danas</a> which will be implemented with Patch 2.4. The instance features four bosses: Selin Fireheart, Vexallus, Priestess Delrissa and none other than Kael'thas Sunstrider himself, who has returned despite his &quot;defeat&quot; in <a href="?zone=3842">Tempest Keep: The Eye</a>.

<br>
It is questionable as to what exactly happened prior to the Tempest Keep encounter; some players are of the opinion that he was merely weakened by the battle while others believe that he was indeed killed in Tempest Keep and has been reanimated by some greater force, generating power from a green crystal now embedded in his chest.
<br>
<br>
This instance features both Normal and Heroic difficulty modes, with the latter featuring epic loot on par with that of later <a href="?zone=2562">Karazhan</a> bosses.
